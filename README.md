# LIME-for-Time-Series
LIME for TimeSeries is an open-source project dedicated to advancing the interpretability of machine learning models focused on time series data. Utilizing the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) technique, this project aims to demystify the decision-making processes of complex models. By integrating perturbation-based explanations, it provides insights into model predictions, enhancing transparency and trust in AI applications across various domains. Ideal for researchers, data scientists, and anyone invested in explainable AI (XAI), this repository offers tools, documentation, and examples to facilitate the understanding and application of LIME in time series analysis.
