# Installation Guide for LIME for Time-Series

This document provides detailed instructions on how to set up and install the LIME for Time-Series project. The project is designed to apply Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) to time-series data, focusing on electrocardiogram (ECG) signal classification.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or newer
- pip (Python package manager)
- Git (for cloning the repository)

## Environment Setup

It is recommended to use a virtual environment for Python projects to manage dependencies efficiently and isolate project environments.

### Creating a Virtual Environment

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/LIME-for-Time-Series

2. Create a virtual environment named venv (you can name it anything you wish):
python3 -m venv venv

3. Activate the virtual environment:
- On Unix/macOS:
source venv/bin/activate

- On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate

### Installing Dependencies

With the virtual environment activated, install the project dependencies using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Be sure to replace `path/to/LIME-for-Time-Series` with the actual path to your local clone of the repository.
